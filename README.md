# Vision-Based Accident Detection System for Smart City

## Problem

Every year in India, approximately 150,000 individuals lose their lives in road accidents. Shockingly, 30-40% of these accidents are ignored or dismissed by the public, mainly to evade unwanted investigations that could jeopardize even more lives.

The delay in the response time to these accidents leads to delayed arrival of ambulance or fire brigade to the spot. In these critical situations every second counts for the life.

Unfortunately, there are no effective measures in place to prevent the loss of lives resulting from such road accidents.
