# Vision-Based Accident Detection System for Smart City

## Problem

Annually, about 150,000 lives are lost to road accidents in India, with a significant percentage going unreported. The delayed response exacerbates the situation, emphasizing the need for a proactive solution.

## Solution

### CCTV-Based Accident Detection

Harnessing existing CCTV infrastructure, our solution detects accidents, triggering rapid responses by alerting emergency services.

#### How it Works

Upon accident detection, CCTV cameras activate, promptly notifying nearby services, including ambulance, fire brigade, and police.

#### Leveraging Existing Resources

Major cities like Delhi, Chennai, and Bengaluru have invested in extensive CCTV networks, repurposing them for accident prevention.
