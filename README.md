# Vision-Based Accident Detection System for Smart City

## Problem

Every year in India, approximately 150,000 individuals lose their lives in road accidents. Shockingly, 30-40% of these accidents are ignored or dismissed by the public, mainly to evade unwanted investigations that could jeopardize even more lives.

The delay in the response time to these accidents leads to delayed arrival of ambulance or fire brigade to the spot. In these critical situations every second counts for the life.

Unfortunately, there are no effective measures in place to prevent the loss of lives resulting from such road accidents.

## Solution

### Leveraging CCTV Cameras for Accident Detection

To address the pressing issue of road accidents, we propose a solution that harnesses the power of existing CCTV cameras installed on roads. 

#### How it Works

When these CCTV cameras detect an accident or the potential for one, they will activate and initiate a swift response by alerting nearby emergency services. This includes notifying ambulance services, the fire brigade, and the police.

#### Utilizing Existing Resources

Notably, several major Indian cities have already invested in CCTV infrastructure:

- Delhi, with 100 cameras primarily used for speed limit monitoring, which can be repurposed for accident detection.
- Chennai's Third Eye campaign, boasting a network of 34,293 cameras originally deployed for speed monitoring, can also be effectively utilized for accident detection.
- Bengaluru, which has proactively installed 5000 surveillance cameras along its roads, adding to the resources available for this initiative.
- This innovative approach aims to improve response times and save lives by making the most of existing technology and resources.
